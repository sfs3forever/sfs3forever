"Jump" URL tags
---------------

What is a "jump" tag?  Well, many people (including the author) didn't like
the really long URLs that MiG uses because it made it clumsy to paste them
into an email, or a chat window, etc.

"Jump" tags were invented to address this problem.  Take this URL for
example:

  http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/index.php?pageType=folder&currDir=./Our%20House/Before%20We%20Redecorated

At 105 characters long, and having tons of URL-encoded %xx type things in
it, it's not a pretty URL to have to send someone.  But here's what you can
do.  Add a line to your mig.cfg that adds to the Jump Map.  There's an
example of this in mig.cfg.default.

  $jumpMap["example"] = "currdir=./Example_Gallery";

That one goes to the example gallery.  To go to the above URL is a little
more like this:

  $jumpMap["house"] = "currDir=./Our%20House/Before%20We%20Redecorated";

See, all I did here was copy the value of "currDir".  Then you can give out
this URL instead:

  http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/?jump=house

Much smaller and nicer.  Imaging if you have albums four or five levels
deep (I know I do) and the URL gets hugely long.  Hopefully this will
address that trouble.

That much said, I will warn you of two things:

1. The label in [] marks in the mig.cfg has to be in double quotes, i.e. ""
   because PHP doesn't seem to like it using single quotes, like ''.

2. This works with Apache web servers.  I don't know if it works with
   anything else.  If you're running something other than Apache, let me
   know how you fare with this feature.
