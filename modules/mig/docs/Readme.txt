REQUIREMENTS
------------

A web server which supports PHP.  PHP3 or PHP4 should work.  Windows users
may be well served by upgrading to a recent version of PHP4.

Some utilities (such as convert-metafiles and mkGallery) require Perl.
mkGallery also requires the ImageMagick "convert" program.  See the file
docs/Utilities.txt for more information.  Perl/ImageMagick are not required
for MiG itself - only if you want to use these bundled utility scripts.


INSTALLATION
------------

Please read the file docs/Install.txt for installation instructions.
Windows users should refer to docs/Windows.txt for install information.

It's also a good idea to read docs/ChangeLog.txt to see what has changed
recently, or just to get an idea of what MiG can do and what its pitfalls
might be.
