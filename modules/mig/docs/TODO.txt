TO DO (Wish List)
-----------------

(Just because something is on this list does not mean it will be in MiG
someday.  This is just a list of things some folks have requested, or that
I have tossed around.  These things may or may not be implemented.  I'd
love to implement many of them but spare time is hard to come by these days.)

- Add a feature to only display X images per page (for large galleries).
  Should be a configurable value (probably in mig.cfg) defaulting to
  "no limit".

- Make content handling more generic to recognize more formats.
  Such as having mp3 files, MPEG video files and such handled by
  MiG as well as image files.

- Mini-search engine function.  Probably something that will index the
  mig.cf comments periodically (and exif.inf files) and build a database
  which could be searched through.  Results would link to pageType=image
  MiG URLs.

- Optional support for thumbnails to be auto-generated (requires the
  web server to have write access into the filesystem).

- Password protection for folders

- option to turn thumbnails off (browser would select this or it could
  be default)

- use_subdir=(0|1) and subdir_name=(string)
  instead of filename format for thumbs, let people do like thumbs/img.jpg
  and sutff instead (some folks would find that cleaner/simpler).

- Optional support for MySQL to store things instead of mig.cf/exif.inf

- New parameter (maybe <Short> ?) which displaces the imagename and sizes
  in thumbnail view and instead shows a "short" comment independent of the
  long comment which is present in <Comment>   (user request)

- Thumbnails of next & previous images on the pageType=image view.

- Ability to use different file types for thumbnail and full-size image.

- Have next / previous image links be buttons rather than anchor links.

- Have folder lists in multiple columns, optionally.
