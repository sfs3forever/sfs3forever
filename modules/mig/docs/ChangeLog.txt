Version 0.98 (Sun Nov 05 2000)
------------------------------

- Added "jump" URL tags.  See docs/Jump.txt for more information.


Version 0.97 (Sat Nov 04 2000)
------------------------------

- Fixed table formatting problem in imageFrame() which caused an extra cell
  to be printed which was visible as a small line in IE browsers.


Version 0.96 (Thu Nov 02 2000)
------------------------------

- Updated docs/Install.txt with notes about file permissions.

- Fixed bug in buildNextPrevLinks() - it was ignoring <Sort> lists.


Version 0.95 (Tue Oct 31 2000)
------------------------------

- Ran the example gallery through a "mogrify -quality 40" to reduce the
  size of the download tarball.  Went from just over 600KB to about 340KB.
  Amazingly, I can't even tell the difference viewing the images.

- Removed a hard-coded value from buildImageURL() which broke things for
  folks who had changed the value of $albumDir.  It was found in three
  places inside that function.

- Made the terms of the licensing clearer according to the FSF GNU
  guidelines at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

- Did a code review looking for potential problems, made minor adjustments.

- Added "interactive" (-i) mode to util/mkGallery.  See docs/Utilities.txt.

- Happy Halloween!


Version 0.94 (Sat Oct 28 2000)
------------------------------

- mkGallery will now sort items before handling them, so output files like
  the comment file will have items alphabetically (for simplicity).

- Fixed bug in buildDirList() that didn't do the rendering of spaces and
  underscores correctly (they should be rendered as &nbsp;).

- Fixed rather large bug in buildDirList() which caused cascading links
  in the output HTML.  This was not very noticeable until one had a large
  list of folders (where large is just a few tens of directories).  A string
  was not being properly reset at the beginning of each loop iteration.


Version 0.93 (Tue 17 Oct 2000)
------------------------------

- Added a question to install.sh which asks the user if they are upgrading
  from 0.83 or earlier (so not everyone for the rest of time has to run
  convert-metafiles anytime they upgrade).

- install.sh will no longer try to guess what directory to install into.

- Discovered that when moving from one page to the next, the text-decoration
  CSS property for anchors (<A> elements) was not reset.  So if you set
  text-decoration=none it would memorize that and not go back to using
  underlines.  So I defined A:* as having text-decoration=underline in
  templates/style.css (which is what you'd expect to see becaues most
  browsers underline links by default).

- Changed link on image view pages that goes back to read "back to
  thumbnail view".  Previously it read "back to folder view" but it has
  been pointed out to me that the wording was confusing.

- Discovered the amazing function GetImageSize().  Now all thumbnail
  views will use width= height= for the thumbnails (this helps speed up the
  browser's rendering of tables), and thumbnail views now show the image
  size in both pixels and bytes.  Single image views will use width=
  height= as well, to help the browser in its rendering task.

- Added new tag %%imageSize%% to the image.html template.

- Switched from using $SCRIPT_NAME to using $PHP_SELF.  This basically
  means MiG should work for people using PHP's CGI mode now.

- Implemented <Sort> element in mig.cf - see docs/mig_cf.txt.


Version 0.92 (Mon 02 Oct 2000)
------------------------------

- Plugged a security hole ($currDir wasn't being checked for ".."!)
  which let viewers see the entire directory stucture of a system.
  Anyone using anything prior to 0.92 should upgrade immediately!


Version 0.91 (Sat 30 Sep 2000)
------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in mf_conv.pl which caused the comment conversion process to
  cascade itself... it stored a list of images and comments in memory,
  but when it entered a new directory it was not cleaning that out, so
  every mig.cf had comments for all the files in all the directories it
  had seen before.  Not particularly dangerous but it litters your mig.cf
  files badly.  This is only a problem for folks who upgraded from a
  release of MiG version 0.83 or earlier, to MiG 0.90 or later.


Version 0.90 (Sat 30 Sep 2000)
------------------------------

- Created "install.sh" to act as an installer script.  Reorganized the
  directory structure somewhat while doing this.

- Updated all documentation.

- Added the #include directive to the template processor.  See the file
  docs/Templates.txt for information.

- Added Windows doc "docs/Windows.txt" for Windows users.  Working on
  .EXE automatic-style installation program.

- Changed name of EXIF header cache file to "exif.inf".

- Because install.sh checks for existing template files and tries to
  figure out the proper thing to do (asking for input if needed), hopefully
  the risk of the installation process blowing away customized templates
  has been eliminated (or at least reduced greatly).  Well, unless you
  happen to use Windows, where I have less versatility with installation
  processes.  See docs/Windows.txt for notes on that topic.

- Devised Apache-like format for meta file "mig.cf" which will hold
  comments, hidden file lists, etc.  This will replace .comments.txt,
  .hidden.txt, etc.  EXIF head info will still live in exif.inf (formerly
  known as .exif_comments.txt).  Documentation is in docs/mig_cf.txt.

- Updated all files to reflect new domain "tangledhelix.com".

- Converted all colorization to use CSS stylesheets.  However, Netscape
  doesn't behave regarding the BODY element and CSS, based on my tests.
  So there's a default color set in the BODY tag in the HTML templates.
  See the file docs/Templates.txt for more information.

- Added tag %%distURL%% for templates.  Removed "MiG" from <TITLE>
  in the default templates.

- Added script "convert-metafiles" to convert metafiles to new format.
  It calls a Perl child process, mf_conv.pl.

- Installer tries to find Perl and if so, sets the #! line for Perl-based
  utility scripts.  This is because folks have Perl installed in places
  that are hard to predict but which are probably in their $PATH.

- Added <Bulletin> feature to mig.cf.  See docs/mig_cf.txt for info.

- "_" (underscore) is now rendered as a space character in the YouAreHere
  line as well as in the folder-list boxes.

- Got <Comment> working, got EXIF parsing working.

- Now in folder / thumbnail views, image comments are loaded as ALT tags,
  so they will pop-up as text when you hover over a link.

- Fixed bug which caused images with spaces in their filename to be handled
  improperly.

- Added $markerType and $markerText to mig.cfg.default.  Added -m and -M
  flags to mkGallery.  These were added to support customizable thumbnail
  naming conventions.  You can now decide what thumbnamil marker name to
  use (previously was forced to be "th".  Also now you can declare it to be
  a prefix (as in "th_filename.JPG") or a suffix (as in "filename_th.JPG").
  Default will be as previous, suffix mode using "th" for filename_th.JPG.
  See docs/Utilities.txt and docs/Install.txt and mig.cfg.default for more
  information.

- Updated mkGallery to read $markerType and $markerLabel from mig.cfg,
  so you don't have to worry about the -M and -m flags as long as your
  mig.cfg has the right options set.

- Changed slashFixedURLencode() to migURLencode().

- Fixed bug in migURLencode() where it would re-encode something
  which was already encoded resulting in a comma becoming %252C instead of
  say, %2C.  It now runs input through rawurldecode() prior to doing a
  rawurlencode() on it.

- Added "-c" option to mkGallery - this will populate the mig.cf file with
  blank <Comment> elements.  It was adapted from mkComments, which was
  contributed by Andr?Fadel <fadel@fee.unicamp.br>.  See docs/Utilities.txt
  for information.

- Fixed bug in getExifDescription() which was returning incorrect values.

- Found bug in the convert-metafiles script which caused directories with
  spaces in the filename to wig the script out.  Fixed.

- Fixed bug in regex used to find comment lines in getExifDescription()
  which would cause extremely long execution times when dealing with large
  exif.inf files.

- Fixed bug which caused improper display of filesizes in thumbnail views.


Version 0.83 (Thu 24 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Images and folders are now sorted alphabetically, to make the sorting
  consistent, if not (yet) completely customizable.


Version 0.82 (Thu 24 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Fixed bug in mkGallery that caused problems parsing filenames with
  embedded spaces.


Version 0.81 (Sat 12 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Changed the behavior of buildYouAreHere() so the browser can't click on
  the "current" item - that is, the current folder or the current image.
  It just seemed silly to recreate the "reload" button.


Version 0.80 (Sat 12 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- The pieces of the "you are here" headline are now clickable for simpler
  navigation between levels.

- Changd the style sheet so the links are underlined again.  People aren't
  used to having it any other way, it was causing confusion.

- Got newCurrDir out of the URI string which makes the URL about 50% as
  long as before.  This entailed adding getNewCurrDir() calls.


Version 0.77 (Sat 12 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Added style sheet support.  See the file templates/style.css.


Version 0.76 (Fri 11 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Rearranged the layout in image.html to make it friendlier for small
  screens.


Version 0.75 (Tue 08 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Fixed overpadded image tables.


Version 0.74 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Cleaned up the HTML layout (mostly shuffling, adding, deleting <BR>).


Version 0.73 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Added a "now viewing #x of y" in image views, so the browser can easily
  tell how many images are left in either direction without returning to
  the thumbnail view.


Version 0.72 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Using colored table cells for comments now.  Embedded comments are
  seperated from file-based comments with an <HR> element.


Version 0.71 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Descriptions are centered now.


Version 0.70 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Bundled "jhead" from Matthias Wandel in order to parse EXIF headers.
  "jhead" will be a child process of "mkGallery" when invoked with "-e".

- Updated mkGallery with new options and code to handle parsing of EXIF
  headers using the "jhead" program.  See the "-e" and "-w" options.
  Also added a "-t" option to specify if you should make thumbnails or
  not (since that's not the only action possible anymore).

- Added function getExifDescription() which parses the .exif_comments.txt
  files for embedded comments and displays them in image views.
  (This file is known as "exif.inf" as of the 0.90 release)


Version 0.61 (Sun 06 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Added "you are here" line, but it's not clickable yet.


Version 0.60 (Sun 06 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Added "hidden" feature.  Anything put into ".hidden.txt" in a directory
  will cause the listed items (one per line) to be rendered invisible.
  This is, of course, optional.

- Cleaned up places where eregi() or eregi_replace() were used when the
  proper call was ereg() or ereg_replace().

- Added "comment" feature.  Comments are stored in .comments.txt.  See
  INSTALL for more information.


Version 0.51 (Sun 06 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Added $homeLink and $homeLabel to config, to print a "back to {home}"
  link at the "root" folder level.


Version 0.50 (Sat 05 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Set default colors so if $imageBGcolor and/or $folderBGcolor are
  missing in the config, it won't default to black.

- Set default $maxColumns in case that is omitted from config file.

- Set default $title in case that is omitted from config file.

- Set default $maintAddr in case that is omitted from config file.

- Got next/previous links working in image views

- Removed "back" link from "main" or "root" of album.


Version 0.41 (Fri 04 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Fixed font size bug with back link on "main" page.


Version 0.40 (Fri 04 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Rewrote mkGallery with 'use strict' and 'perl -w'

- Symlinked index.php3 to index.php for simplicity.

- Replaced "<<" in buildBackLink() with "&lt;&lt;" and cleaned up
  other such bits throughout the code.

- Replaced most spaces in templates & PHP with "&nbsp;" due to odd
  formatting problems with MSIE.

- Wrote table generation code into PHP and took it out of the template
  files due to MSIE's stupid insistence on displaying empty tables with
  a tiny colored square.

- Cleaned up (simplified) templates a little.

- Added variables $imageBGcolor and $folderBGcolor, which are background
  colors for the table backgrounds for the image and folder tables,
  respectively.  They can be found in mig.cfg.default.

- Documented templates in templates/README.templates.
  (This can now be found in docs/Templates.txt as of 0.90)


Version 0.36 (Tue 01 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Got rid of $phpExt - include files aren't seen by the web server
  anyway, so the extension wasn't relevant.


Version 0.35 (Tue 01 Aug 2000)
------------------------------

- Reworked page formatting.  Now if there are no folders and no images
  present, the browser gets "No contents".  If no folders, the folder table
  isn't printed.  If no images, the images table isn't printed.  If there
  are both, you see both tables.  The result is less confusing.

- If mig.cfg is missing, mig.cfg.default will be read instead, to avoid
  any errors popping up. 


Version 0.34 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)
------------------------------

- Added a second back link to each page since pages can grow long enough
  that having one at the top and one at the bottom is desirable.


Version 0.33 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)
------------------------------

- Added filesize to the thumbnails page


Version 0.32 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)
------------------------------

- Fixed a stupid bug ($maxColumns was being ignored).  Table layouts
  on thumbnail pages should work now.


Version 0.31 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)
------------------------------

- If a thumbnail is missing, a generic image will be used in its place.


Version 0.3 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)
-----------------------------

- The "back" link is now grayed out when at the "main" page.

- Fixed bug in mkGallery that would cause it to create thumbnails of
  already-existing thumbnail images.

- Viewing a folder will now show the thumbnail images correctly.

- Added template "image.html" to view individual images.

- Removed the "you are at" headline, the help function, and the "exit"
  button.  The latter two were never too useful, and the former is a real
  pain to get working.  I'll save it for some future release.

- Added $phpExt variable for PHP3 users who might need filenames with
  ".php3" extensions instead of ".php".

- Added $pageTitle to insert into the <TITLE> element of each template.

- Removed *currLocation routines

- Started using 'mig.cfg.default' for dist bundles to avoid over-writing
  old config files.

- Fixed a bug which caused image view "back" links to go not to the
  previous page, but literally to "../"

- Fixed URL pointer in the HTML templates to reflect correct MiG
  distribution URL.


Version 0.2 (Sun 30 Jul 2000)
-----------------------------

- The 'mkGallery' utility script is complete.  Requires Perl and
  ImageMagick.  No other significant changes in 0.2.


Version 0.1 (Fri 28 Jul 2000)
-----------------------------

- Initial version.

- Got "any directory anywhere" directory browsing working correctly.
  An album can have any number of directories and subdirectories now.
  This is much better than the old 2-level directory model.

- Changed direction on the topic of thumbnail generation.  It's better to
  pre-generate them instead of having the PHP code do it on the fly.
  Having the script get reliable write access to the filesystem proved
  to be a bit more sloppy than I originally thought.

- The old method of using numeric filenames is gone now (thank god).

- Support for JPEG/GIF/PNG formats should be good enough.  Old model of
  supporting only one file type sucked.

- Nailed down an HTML layout finally, simpler than others I have seen,
  more attractive than the previous ones used in "album.php3".

- Got HTML templates working.

- Added a help link, back link, and a mailto: link to each page.
  Each page also has a link back to the distribution URL.

- Got the "you are here" path to display, but no links yet.

- Got rid of the old problem from album.php3 where the path had to be
  statically set in the code ahead of time (and the fact that tilde-URLs
  like /~dan/ didn't work).  This time around the script figures out where
  it is in the filesystem and bases everything else on that path.

- Added the "exit" link to take browser to an outside URL.
